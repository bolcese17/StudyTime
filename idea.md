In simple terms, a time manager for students. The idea is to keep track of time spent doing work for class and time spent on recreational activity. Specifically, the problem I have is how much time should I be spending on school work, and more so how muc time should I be spending on certain classes. A program to compare the time spent in class, time spent doing work for that class, and time spent just studying the material for that class, to other students who have taken that class.
